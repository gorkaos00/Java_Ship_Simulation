# Java_Ship_Simulation
Thread-based Java project 

A project for study in Java, using the JavaFX library. The project aims to simulate a situation in which a certain number of people can board a ship, assuming that the bridge between the ship and the shore, has a limited capacity.
The project is realised by running on threads.
